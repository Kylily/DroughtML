# DroughtML
A classifier model built using computer vision resnet18 in fastai that classifies whether an image is of a drought or not.
The model was directly coded in jupyter notebook so it can be opened and copied into jupyter notebook to be played around with!
This classifier was heavily based on Jeremy Howard's https://github.com/fastai/fastbook and course in fastai.
